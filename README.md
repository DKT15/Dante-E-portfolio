# Dante-Advanced-portfolio

## Description

This portfolio's purpose, is to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. This website is to hold all of the web applications I build to show my capabilities. This project will hopefully enable me to standout to employers, so I don't have to just rely on my CV/Resume.

Whilst doing this project, I have learnt about HTML, CSS Grids, CSS flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
